## We won first place!
Together with: @FlavioAmurrioCS, @hshin23

Description: A working iOS app that allows a George Mason University student to sign up for an account and once verified, he/she can start selling items for free. This allows other student to buy stuff from other students without the fear of being scammed.

## Problem:
- When buying or selling goods on the internet, safety is a concern
- The selection of goods can get overwhelming
- Sometimes the distance to the seller could be an issue

## Solution:
- We create a mobile application named UniSell
- This app requires sign up from people with a @gmu.edu email address
- It has sms verification upon registration
- Browse goods from people at GMU
